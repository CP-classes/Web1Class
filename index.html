	<blockquote class="quote">technology alone is not enough. It is technology married with the liberal arts 
married with the humanities that make our hearts sing. 
When you keep people at the center of what you do, it can have an enormous impact. 
It means an iPhone that allows the blind person to run a marathon. 
It means an Apple Watch that catches a heart condition before it becomes a heart attack. 
It means an iPad that helps a child with autism connect with his or her world. 
In short, it means technology infused with your values, making progress possible for everyone.

<!-->
	most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. 
		People think it’s this veneer – that the designers are handed this box and told, 
	“Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. 
		It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. 
		Design is how it works.<--!>
